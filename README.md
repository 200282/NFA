The program takes an infix regular expression, constructs a corresponding parse tree and
recursively evaluates it to make a non-deterministic finite automata . 

Supports the three classic regular expression operations :

1)Concatenation   ab

2)Union           a|b

3)Kleene closure   a*

4)positive closure  b+
